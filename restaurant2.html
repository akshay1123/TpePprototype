When on zomato it said buffet,u normally expect a self service thing,it's different here,the waiters run around serving, and boy is that a bad idea, I happen to be a pure vegetarian and was served chicken soup( this was done after I asked the waiter to recheck if it was veg, so no comments) the only saving grace would be their starters. You get 5 veg starters and my favourite was corn cubes and chilli sticks.( 5 for non veg too) For main course,you have the option of butter garlic noodles and fried noodles with a gravy of your choice. We chose vegetables in kung pao, the kung pao was not a disappointment, but the noodles were. Coming to dessert,you get chocolate rolls,( they are not stuffed with chocolate,so don't get ideas). Daarsan and vanilla ice cream"
